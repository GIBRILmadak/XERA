# XERA Egress Optimization & Bot Shutdown

**Date**: May 3, 2026  
**Issue**: Supabase Service Restricted due to excessive Egress (data out) with minimal active users  
**Root Cause**: Unoptimized database queries (`.select("*")`), unnecessary polling loops, and bot runner consuming quota.

---

## ✅ Changes Applied

### 1. **Bot Runner - Complete Shutdown**

- **File**: `server/bot-runner.js`
- **Change**: Disabled the infinite loop (`while(true)`)
- **Impact**: Bots no longer generate new posts, encouragements, or follows
- **Data Preservation**: All existing bot posts remain in the database
- **Status**: `process.exit(0)` on startup with notification

```bash
# If bot-runner is running, kill it:
ps aux | grep bot-runner
pkill -f "node.*bot-runner"
```

### 2. **Polling Loops Reduction**

#### Admin Bots Dashboard (`js/admin-bots.js`)

- **Before**: `setInterval(refresh, 60 * 1000)` → polling every 60s
- **After**: Polling disabled (no point with bots stopped)
- **Egress Saved**: ~100 requests/day per admin

#### Creator Dashboard (`js/creator-dashboard.js`)

- **Before**: `setInterval(..., 30000)` → polling every 30s
- **After**: `setInterval(..., 10 * 60 * 1000)` → polling every 10 minutes
- **Rationale**: Realtime subscriptions handle most updates; polling is fallback only
- **Egress Saved**: ~2,880 requests/day → ~432 requests/day (85% reduction)

#### Discover Grid Auto-Refresh (`js/app-supabase.js`)

- **Before**: `const LIVE_REFRESH_MS = 20000` → refresh every 20s
- **After**: `const LIVE_REFRESH_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000` → refresh every 5 minutes
- **Rationale**: Realtime subscriptions handle content updates; polling is fallback
- **Egress Saved**: Per user, ~4,320 requests/day → ~288 requests/day (93% reduction)

### 3. **Database Query Optimization**

#### Frontend - Content Fetches (`js/supabase-config.js`)

- **Before**: `select("*")` on `content` table (returns all columns including JSON metadata)
- **After**: Explicit column list:
    ```sql
    id, user_id, project_id, arc_id, day_number, type, state, title,
    description, media_url, media_urls, views, encouragements_count,
    created_at, is_deleted, deleted_at, deleted_reason
    ```
- **Impact**: ~40-50% reduction in payload per content fetch

#### Frontend - Realtime Debounce (`js/app-supabase.js`)

- **Before**: Immediate `getUserContent()` call on every realtime event
- **After**: 3-second debounce per user to batch multiple events
- **Impact**: Prevents query storms on high-frequency content updates

#### Server - Profile Fetch (`server/monetization-server.js` - `fetchProfileRecordById`)

- **Before**: `select("*")` returns all user columns
- **After**: Explicit columns:
    ```sql
    id, name, avatar, banner, bio, title, social_links, email,
    followers_count, updated_at, plan, plan_status, plan_ends_at,
    badge, is_monetized, account_type, account_subtype
    ```
- **Impact**: ~30-40% payload reduction per profile fetch

#### Server - Discover Users (`server/monetization-server.js` - `fetchDiscoverUsers`)

- **Before**: `select("*")` with no limit
- **After**:
    ```sql
    select("id, name, avatar, followers_count, title, bio, plan, updated_at")
    .limit(100)
    ```
- **Impact**:
    - Reduced columns: ~50% payload reduction
    - Added limit: Prevents full table transfer
    - Combined: ~70-80% egress reduction

#### Bot Runner - Active Bots Query (`server/bot-runner.js` - `fetchActiveBots`)

- **Before**: `select("*")`
- **After**: Explicit columns: `id, user_id, display_name, avatar_url, schedule_hour, active, last_action_at, encourage_days, meta`
- **Impact**: ~40% payload reduction (mostly for documentation; runner is disabled)

## 📊 Estimated Egress Reduction

| Component                   | Before             | After            | Reduction          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Creator Dashboard Polling   | 2,880 req/day      | 432 req/day      | 85%                |
| Discover Auto-Refresh       | 4,320 req/day      | 288 req/day      | 93%                |
| Admin Bots Polling          | ~100 req/day       | 0 req/day        | 100%               |
| Avg. Payload Size (queries) | 100%               | 40-50%           | 50-60%             |
| **Total Egress Impact**     | **~7,300 req/day** | **~720 req/day** | **~90% reduction** |

## 🔍 Remaining Considerations

### Realtime Subscriptions (Active)

The following realtime subscriptions remain active and are necessary:

- `public:content` — for content feed updates
- `public:streaming_sessions` — for live stream status
- `server-push-relay-notifications` — for push notifications (server-side)
- `server-push-relay-dm` — for direct messages (server-side)
- Streaming chat realtime — for live chat updates

**No optimization needed here** — these respond to user actions and are critical for real-time UX.

### Client-Side Streaming Intervals

Streaming-related intervals (chat sync, viewer heartbeat, viewer count) remain unchanged:

- These are **only active during active streams** (user-initiated)
- They are essential for live streaming functionality
- No reduction applied

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Commit & push all changes**

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Reduce Egress: disable bot runner, optimize queries, reduce polling"
    git push origin main
    ```

- [ ] **Kill any running bot processes** (if any)

    ```bash
    pkill -f "node.*bot-runner"
    ```

- [ ] **Deploy to production** (Vercel or your deployment platform)
    - This will auto-reload all changed files
    - Monitor Supabase dashboard for egress metric changes (should drop within 1-2 hours)

- [ ] **Monitor Supabase Metrics**
    - Visit: https://app.supabase.com → Project → Usage
    - Watch for **Egress (Data Out)** metric
    - Should see significant drop (target: 90% reduction)

- [ ] **Verify Functionality**
    - Test: Profile loading
    - Test: Content feed refresh
    - Test: Discover grid
    - Test: Admin dashboard (if needed)
    - Test: Creator dashboard

## 🔧 To Re-Enable Bots (Future)

If you want to re-enable the bot runner in the future:

1. Edit `server/bot-runner.js` and uncomment the loop:

    ```javascript
    async function main() {
        console.log("Bot runner started");
        while (true) {
            await loopOnce();
            await sleep(60 * 1000);
        }
    }
    ```

2. Commit and redeploy

## 📝 Notes

- **All bot posts** (content, encouragements) created before this change remain in the database
- **Bots are now inactive** but not deleted — you can reactivate them later or delete them with:
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM bots WHERE active = true;
    DELETE FROM users WHERE is_bot = true;
    ```
- **Realtime subscriptions** are the primary data-sync mechanism now — ensure they remain stable
- If Egress does not drop sufficiently, investigate:
    - Are bots still somehow running? (check processes)
    - Are there Edge Functions making external API calls? (check `api/` directory)
    - Are there browser extensions or middleware making duplicate requests?
